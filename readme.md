Eurovision Song Contest ESC Hack
This is the "hack" from the Eurovision song contest half time show.
The joke was that the escape key was the eurovision song contest button and it played the eurovision theme every time you pressed it.
As i have a very low standard for jokes and puns i made an auto hot key script for this exact purpose.
## Installation
If you have auto hot key installed you can run ESChack.ahk directly otherwise you can use the executable (ESChack.exe)
You can view the source in ESChack.ahk with your regular txt viewer.
## Usage
1. Launch the program and it will appear in your system tray.
2. press escape.
3. profit!

## Why?
Because i am lame.
